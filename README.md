# Pong

A modified version of Mini Tennis from, Edu4 Java: Game Programming for Beginners. (http://www.edu4java.com/en/game/game0-en.html)

This game has 2 players. Player 1 gets the lower racquet, while player 2 gets the upper one. To move the racquet of player 1, use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys. To move the racquet of player 2, use the characters 'A'(to go left) and 'D'(to go right). Each player shoud be able to catch the ball with their racquets. The first player to get 3 points, wins. After the game ends, user can restart a new game if he wants to.

Currently fixing:
  a) bugs
  b) making the players use one racquet class only
  
Hopefully, to be added soon:
  - a power-up, where the ball will move faster towards the opponent when the player wants to.
