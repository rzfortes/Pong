# Pong

To myself,
  
  These are the things you need to do:
  
  -fix bugs 
    a.) the direction of the ball when player2 racquet and ball collides, 
    b.) the movement of racquets (note that, there's a conflict when both racquets are moved to the same direction. Galisod ang listener           kinsa ang unahon i-move or kinsa jud ang i-move if same direction ang both racquets),
    c.) hahahahahahahah, usahay mu-jump ang score bigger than 1 (like 17 dayon ang score if ang ball and racquet is in the corner jud).
  -figure out how to delete the previous JFrame or reset it man lang.. (this is in JOptionPane, where there's an option (duh, haha) to or    not to restart game
  -add power-up!
  -change the color of the sprite..
  -CHANGE THE SOUND EFFECTS HUHU.. HOW.. WHERE TO START.. HUHU (because creepy hahahhahahhahahha)
  -EDIT, REVISE! Check if there's more pretty way to implement things especially the winner part in Game Over function, and some other        things
  -Lastly, description for this game, here! (This can be done on Wed xD)
  
  -END-
