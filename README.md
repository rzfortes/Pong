# Pong


A modified version of Mini Tennis from, Edu4 Java: Game Programming for Beginners. (http://www.edu4java.com/en/game/game0-en.html)

This game has 2 players. Player 1 gets the lower racquet, while player 2 gets the upper one. To move the racquet of player 1, use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys. To move the racquet of player 2, use the characters 'A' (to go left) and 'D' (to go right). Each player should be able to catch the ball with their racquets. Since a power-up has not yet been added, the speed of the ball increases by 1 everytime it hits the racquets. The first player to get 3 points, wins. But if a player fails to catch the ball, opponent will get the last point and wins. After the game ends, user can restart a new game if he wants to.

To be fixed:
  a) bugs
  b) background sound/music
  
Update:
  - players already uses one racquet class only. The thing is, if player 1's racquet moves, player 2's racquet will not be able to move. And vice versa.
  - changed the gameover sound to (a/an) 8 bit pingpong sound from, OpenGameArt.Org (http://opengameart.org/content/3-ping-pong-sounds-8-bit-style) The "sounds_ping_pong_8bit.zip" file was the only one downloaded from the site.
  
Hopefully, to be added soon:
  - a power-up, where the ball will move faster towards the opponent when the player wants to. 

This game serves as an MP requirement for CMSC 22 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming under Sir Nico Martin A. EÃ±ego.

should fix on Christmas break.
