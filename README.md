# Pong


A modified version of Mini Tennis from, Edu4 Java: Game Programming for Beginners. (http://www.edu4java.com/en/game/game0-en.html)

This game has 2 players. Player 1 gets the lower racquet, while player 2 gets the upper one. To move the racquet of player 1, use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys. To move the racquet of player 2, use the characters 'A' (to go left) and 'D' (to go right). Each player should be able to catch the ball with their racquets. The first player to get 3 points, wins. But if a player fails to catch the ball, opponent will get the last point and wins. After the game ends, user can restart a new game if he wants to.

Currently fixing:
  a) bugs
  b) sound effects
  
Update:
  - players already uses one racquet class only. The thing is, if player 1's racquet moves, player 2's racquet will not be able to move. And vice versa.
  
Hopefully, to be added soon:
  - a power-up, where the ball will move faster towards the opponent when the player wants to. 

This game serves as an MP requirement for CMSC 22 Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming under Sir Nico Martin A. EÃ±ego.
